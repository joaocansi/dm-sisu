**DM-SISU** is a simple **Jupyter Notebook** project designed to extract data from [sisu.mec.gov.br](https://sisu.mec.gov.br). This website is renowned for providing information about public college acceptances in Brazil. Each year, new college vacancies are made available, and this data can be accessed through an API.

## Where can I find the data?

If you're interested in accessing the extracted data, you can find it at the following link: [Data Repository](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10crNoixU1iFUMOiZUHQL52ernK_pAUig?usp=drive_link). There, you'll find both Excel and CSV files containing the extracted data.

## How can I run?

To run this project, simply open it in your preferred IDE or environment. If you're not familiar with Jupyter Notebooks, I recommend following the instructions provided by your IDE for running these types of files.

**Note**: This project has no specific requirements, but ensure you're using an updated version of Python to avoid any compatibility issues.
